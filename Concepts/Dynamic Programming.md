# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is an approach where you reuse the already computed results (which are stored) instead of recomputing again. 

In dynamic programming you will be computing and storing results for all possible [[State]]s [[Greedy]] where you only visit very few [[State]]s. Which is why [[Dynamic Programming]] approach is slower compared to [[Greedy]].
