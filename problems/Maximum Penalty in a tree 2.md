# Maximum Penalty in a tree

Given a binary tree. Where each node can be almost underhydrated, hydrated and almost over hydrated. 
Given two values p1, p2 (penalty) for underhydrated and overhydrated respectively. 
When you water a node all its children are also watered. water = (almost underhydrated → hydrated) + (almost over hydrated → overhydrated). 
You need to water exactly once. Find the minimum total penalty you can obtain?
