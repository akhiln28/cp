Implement a data structure `PlaylistQueue` with the following methods

- `PlaylistQueue(String[] songs)` which initializes a playlist of songs.
- `String play(int i)` which returns the `i`th song in the playlist, removes it from the queue, and appends it to the end of the queue.

**Constraints**

- `0 ≤ n ≤ 200,000` where `n` is the length of `songs`
- `0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the number of calls to `play`

****Input****

`methods = ["constructor", "play", "play", "play", "play"]`
`arguments = [[["a", "b", "c"]], [0], [1], [2], [0]]``

****Output****

`[null, "a", "c", "c", "b"]`

### **Explanation**

```
q = PlaylistQueue(["a", "b", "c"])
q.play(0) == "a" # Queue becomes ["b", "c", "a"]
q.play(1) == "c" # Queue becomes ["b", "a", "c"]
q.play(2) == "c" # Queue becomes ["b", "a", "c"]
q.play(0) == "b" # Queue becomes ["a", "c", "b"]
```

### **Explanation**

```
q = PlaylistQueue(["a", "b", "c", "d"])
q.play(0) == "a" # Queue becomes ["b", "c", "d", "a"]
q.play(0) == "b" # Queue becomes ["c", "d", "a", "b"]
q.play(0) == "c" # Queue becomes ["d", "a", "b", "c"]
q.play(0) == "d" # Queue becomes ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
q.play(0) == "a" # Queue becomes ["b", "c", "d", "a"]
```
