Polycarp was presented with a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n. However, when Polycarp came home, he noticed that in his pocket, the permutation p had turned into an array q according to the following rule:

qi=max(p1,p2,…,pi)

Now Polycarp wondered what lexicographically minimal and lexicographically maximal permutations could be presented to him.
