# LRU Cache Implementation

For implementing LRU cache. Use the following 
1. A doubly linked list for storing the order (Most recently used at the front and least recently used at the back)
2. And hash table for storing the key (page) and value (pointer to node in linked list)
Patterns: [Matrix](Matrix.md)[Hashing](Hashing.md)
