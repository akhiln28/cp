# Minimum cost you need to spend to get required value

You are given an array of items. Each item has a cost and value associated to it. Find the minimum cost you need to spend to get a total value of v? (this is just an extension of the cleaning the phone problem)
Consider the following examples: 
[2, 2, 5, 6, 1] → cost array
[3, 4, 5, 8, 2] → value array
minimum value = 8
