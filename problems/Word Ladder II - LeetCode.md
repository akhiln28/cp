# Word Ladder II - LeetCode

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words such that:
- The first word in the sequence is `beginWord`.
- The last word in the sequence is `endWord`.
- Only one letter is different between each adjacent pair of words in the sequence.
- Every word in the sequence is in `wordList`.
Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return *all the **shortest transformation sequences** from* `beginWord` *to* `endWord`*, or an empty list if no such sequence exists.*
**Example 1:**
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All the strings in `wordList` are **unique**.
