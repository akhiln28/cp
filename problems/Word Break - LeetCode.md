# Word Break - LeetCode

Given a **non-empty** string *s* and a dictionary *wordDict* containing a list of **non-empty** words, determine if *s* can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
**Note:**
- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Â             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
```

$dp[i] \rightarrow$ denotes whether $0...i$ can be expressed as using the given word dictionary. 
```python
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_set<string> words;
    bool wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        for (int i = 0; i < wordDict.size(); i++)
            words.insert(wordDict[i]); 
        vector<bool> dp(s.length(), false); 
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
        {
            for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--)
            {
                if (words.count(s.substr(j, i - j + 1)) and (j == 0 or dp[j - 1])) dp[i] = true;
            }
        }
        return dp[s.length() - 1]; 
    }
};
```
