The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return *all distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle***.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

**Example 1:**

Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]

```

**Example 2:**
