Charles gave Ada a string  of length , consisting of uppercase letters and asked her to convert it into a string with a goodness score of . In one operation, Ada can change any character in the string to any uppercase letter. Could you help Ada find the minimum number of operations required to transform the given string into a string with goodness score equal to ?

### Input

The first line of each test case contains two integers  and . The second line of each test case contains a string  of length , consisting of uppercase letters.

### Output

For each test case, output one line containing `Case #:` , where  is the test case number (starting from 1) and  is the minimum number of operations required to transform the given string  into a string with goodness score equal to .
