You are given an integer array `nums` and you have to return a new `counts` array. The `counts` array has the property where `counts[i]` is the number of smaller elements to the right of `nums[i]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1]
Output: [0]

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-1]
Output: [0,0]

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
