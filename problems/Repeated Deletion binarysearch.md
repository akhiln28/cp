# Repeated Deletion | binarysearch

Given a string `s`, repeatedly delete the earliest consecutive duplicate characters.
**Constraints**
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`.
### **Explanation**
- "bbb" are the earliest consecutive duplicate characters which gets deleted. So we have "aaac".
- "aaa" then gets deleted to end up with "c".
