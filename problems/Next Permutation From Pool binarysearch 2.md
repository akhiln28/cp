# Next Permutation From Pool | binarysearch

You are given two strings `digits` and `lower` both representing decimal numbers. Given that you can rearrange `digits` in any order, return the smallest number that's larger than `lower`. You can assume there is a solution.
**Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `digits`
- `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000` where `m` is the length of `lower`
