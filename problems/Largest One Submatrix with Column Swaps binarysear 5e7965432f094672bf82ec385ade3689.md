Status: done

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers `matrix` containing `1`s and `0`s. Given that you can first rearrange the columns as many times as you want, return the area of the largest submatrix containing all `1`s.

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ n * m ≤ 100,000` where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`
