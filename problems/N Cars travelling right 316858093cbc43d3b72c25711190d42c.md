Problem Statement: You have n cars, travelling to right. Each having distinct speed limit. A car cannot exceed speed to that of car infront of it (to avoid collision). A car always travels with maximum possible speed. Given the speeds are chosen at random, what is the expected number of groups they form.
Status: done
