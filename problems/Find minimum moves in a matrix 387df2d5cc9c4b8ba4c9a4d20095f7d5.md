Given a grid . Find minimum moves to go from position (0,0) to (n-1,n-1). But, the grid will have some obstacles and we can only go through **at most k obstacles.** Free position will be marked 0 and obstacle will be denoted by 1. I took my time and came up with optimized Dijkstra with some modifications.
