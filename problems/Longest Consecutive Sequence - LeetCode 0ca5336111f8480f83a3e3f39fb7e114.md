Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Follow up:** Could you implement the `O(n)` solution?
