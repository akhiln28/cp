[Asked in Google - 2020, Goldman Sachs - 2020 
Given two Array. 
A = [1,3,4,2,5,6] B = [3,4,6,5,7] 
we have to remove 3,1,2,6 and Insert 6,7 to make A equal to B. 
we can delete and insert any element at anywhere from first array and make that array same as second array. Output is Minimum Number of elements required to be insert in first array. 
constraints: 
1 <= First Array Size <= 10^5 
1<= Second Array SIze <= 10^5 
1 <= firstarray[i] <= 10^9 
1 <= secondarray <= 10^9 
second array consist of distinct element. 
Note : it is same as edit distance but here our constraints are 10^5.](https://www.careercup.com/question?id=5736582460473344)
