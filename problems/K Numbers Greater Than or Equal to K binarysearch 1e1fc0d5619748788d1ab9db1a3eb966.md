You are given a list of non-negative integers `nums`. If there are exactly `k` numbers in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `k`, return `k`. Otherwise, return `-1`.

**Constraints**

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`

### **Explanation**

There are exactly `3` numbers that's greater than or equal to `3`: `[5, 3, 9]`.
