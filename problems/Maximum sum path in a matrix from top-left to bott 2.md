# Maximum sum path in a matrix from top-left to bottom-right - GeeksforGeeks

Given a matrix **mat[][]** of dimensions **N * M**, the task is to find the path from the **top-left cell** (0, 0) to the **bottom-right cell** (N – 1, M – 1) of the given matrix such that sum of the elements in the path is maximum. The only moves allowed from any cell (i, j) of the matrix are **(i + 1, j)** or **(i, j + 1)**.
