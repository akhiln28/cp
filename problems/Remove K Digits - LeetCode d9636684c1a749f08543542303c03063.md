Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

**Note:**

- The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k
- The given  num does not contain any leading zero

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
```

This is like choosing n - k digits to form the least number.
