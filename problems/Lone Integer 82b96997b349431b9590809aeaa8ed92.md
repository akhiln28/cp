Given an array in which each element occurs exactly 3 times except for one element. Find that element in O(1) space?

- my solution

    **Brute force method**: We can simply do **sorting** and then find the element which is not equal to the neighbours. 

    ```cpp
    int solve(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> v(31); 
        for (int j = 0; j < 31; j++)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
            {
                v[j] += (1 & (nums[i] >> j)); 
            }
        }
        
        int ans = 0; 
        for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++)
        {
            ans += (v[i] % 3) * (1 << i);
        }
        return ans; 
    }
    ```

There are 31 bits. For each position find the total number of ones in that position. The ith position of the unique element is the (number of ones in that position) % 3. 

### Complexity

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)
