Given an array, rotate the array to the right by *k* steps, where *k* is non-negative.

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 105`

---

```jsx
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        k = k % nums.size(); 
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
        reverse(nums.begin() + k, nums.end());
    }
};
```
