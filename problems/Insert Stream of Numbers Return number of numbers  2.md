# Insert Stream of Numbers: Return number of numbers less than current

You will be given a stream of integers, for each number you need to return the number of integers less than the current element?
We need a struture like [BST [getting the kth smallest element]](BST%20%5Bgetting%20the%20kth%20smallest%20element%5D%20c4eab2aacf694a73a4a3ed60e2ddb104.md)
