Status: ok

Given a **non-empty** array `nums` containing **only positive integers**, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

**Example 1:**

```
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
