### Problem Statement
In Takahashi Kingdom, there are N towns, called Town 1 through Town N.
 There are also M roads in the kingdom, called Road 1 through Road M. By traversing Road i, you can travel from Town Xi to Town Yi, but not vice versa. Here, it is guaranteed that Xi < Yi.

 Find the maximum possible profit (that is, the selling price minus the buying price) in this plan.
