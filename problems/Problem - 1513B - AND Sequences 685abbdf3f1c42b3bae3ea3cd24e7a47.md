Virtual contest is a way to take part in past contest, as close as possible to participation on time. It is supported only ICPC mode for virtual contests. If you've seen these problems, a virtual contest is not for you - solve these problems in the archive. If you just want to solve some problem from a contest, a virtual contest is not for you - solve this problem in the archive. Never use someone else's code, read the tutorials or communicate with other person during a virtual contest.

In the first test case, since all the numbers are equal, whatever permutation we take, the sequence is good. There are a total of  permutations possible with numbers from  to : , , , , , .

In the second test case, it can be proved that no permutation exists for which the sequence is good.

In the third test case, there are a total of  permutations for which the sequence is good. One of them is the permutation  which results in the sequence . This is a good sequence because
